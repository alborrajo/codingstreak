Streak counter for VS Code

## Features

Shows on the status bar, at the bottom of the window, a fire icon with a number, showing the amount of consecutive days you've used VS Code.
The streak is global for every workspace.

## Known Issues

The streak is updated only at the application's startup. If you leave VS Code open overnight, the streak doesn't count both days.
